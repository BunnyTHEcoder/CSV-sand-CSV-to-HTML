# CSV-and-CSV-to-HTML
Combining CSV’s and creating some  static HTML pages from data in CSV files


Plastyco manufactures sheets of plastic and has a process that scans for defects in 100×100
grid locations. Sheets with defects can still be salvaged so long as the following conditions
are met:
• There are no more than 8 defects overall
• There are no more than 4 defects in any 3×3 square

we have a folder containing a large number of CSV files. Each CSV should have a
column called key that should be used as the index. If the file does not have a key column, it
should be skipped.
Most of the files will have a similar set of columns, with some variations. We need to
combine all the data from each file into a single DataFrame.

create some very basic static HTML pages from data in CSV files.
